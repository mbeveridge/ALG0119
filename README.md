# Knight Center MOOC : "[News Algorithms: The Impact of Automation & AI on Journalism](https://journalismcourses.org/ALG0119.html)"
###### 11/2/19 - 10/3/19

Nick Diakopoulos [[Computational Journalism Lab](http://cjlab.stanford.edu/) (CJL) : Director]

## Syllabus
### Module 1: Algorithmic News Media
A broad overview of how algorithmic approaches are being used throughout journalism, including in areas like content production and computational story discovery.

We’ll talk about which **tasks algorithms are good at** [*Calculate; Prioritize; Classify; Associate; Filter*], which **tasks people are still better at** [*Complex communication; Expert Thinking; Dynamic*], and about how to blend algorithms and people together in productive workflows. We’ll also talk about what it means to develop computational thinking skills and how to apply them in news production. This module will cover:

* What algorithms are and **how they’re used in news production** ...[*Data mining; Automated content production; Algorithmic news distribution*]
* How data mining can **help monitor for and discover** news stories ...[*Benefits : More comprehensive; Continuous monitoring; Speed*]
* How to apply **computational thinking in your work** ...[*Facets : Modeling; Decomposition (of tasks); Parameterization*]


### Module 2: Automated Content Production
A lot more detail on automated content production, so you know when it might be appropriate to deploy. I’ll also demonstrate the basics for how to write a template using a tool called **[Arria Studio](https://www.arria.com/)**, which is a word processor for creating your own automated content.

This module will cover:

* How automated content works and is used by news organizations ...[*‘Standard NLG Model’ (3 phases)*]
* What the **benefits and limitations** of automated content are for news production ...[*Benefits : Speed; Scale; Accuracy; Personalization*] [*Limitations :*]
* How to write a template to drive automated text production


### Module 3: Algorithms in News Curation and Dissemination

### Module 4: Algorithmic Accountability & Transparency
