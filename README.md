# Knight Center MOOC : "[News Algorithms: The Impact of Automation & AI on Journalism](https://journalismcourses.org/ALG0119.html)"
###### 11/2/19 - 10/3/19

Nick Diakopoulos [[Computational Journalism Lab](http://cjlab.stanford.edu/) (CJL) : Director]

## Syllabus
### Module 1: Algorithmic News Media
A broad overview of how algorithmic approaches are being used throughout journalism, including in areas like content production and computational story discovery.

We’ll talk about which **tasks algorithms are good at** [*Calculate; Prioritize; Classify; Associate; Filter*], which **tasks people are still better at** [*Complex communication; Expert Thinking; Dynamic*], and about how to blend algorithms and people together in productive workflows. We’ll also talk about what it means to develop computational thinking skills and how to apply them in news production. This module will cover:

* What algorithms are and **how they’re used in news production** ...[*Data mining; Automated content production; Algorithmic news distribution*]
* How data mining can **help monitor for and discover** news stories ...[*Benefits : More comprehensive; Continuous monitoring; Speed*]
* How to apply **computational thinking in your work** ...[*Facets : Modeling; Decomposition (of tasks); Parameterization*]


### Module 2: Automated Content Production
A lot more detail on automated content production, so you know when it might be appropriate to deploy. I’ll also demonstrate the basics for how to write a template using a tool called **[Arria Studio](https://www.arria.com/studio/studio-overview/)**, which is a word processor for creating your own automated content. This module will cover:

* How automated content works and is used by news organizations ...[*‘Standard NLG Model’ (3 phases)*]
* What the **benefits and limitations** of automated content are for news production ...[*Benefits : Speed; Scale; Accuracy; Personalization*] [*Limitations : Data access; Why & How; Social&Legal reasoning; Writing quality*]
* How to write a template to drive automated text production ...[*[Arria Studio](https://www.arria.com/studio/studio-overview/)*]


### Module 3: Algorithms in News Curation & Dissemination
We’ll talk about algorithms in news curation & dissemination, (like at Google, Facebook, and Apple News), which use algorithms in different ways **to drive exposure to content**. We’ll also talk about how to think about metrics and **how editorial criteria can be encoded into the curation algorithms**. This module will cover:

* The role and power of platform curation algorithms in news **distribution**
* Approaches to content **optimization** and how to think about **metrics** for content optimization ...[*Approaches : A/B Headline Testing; Recommendation widgets; Timing*] [*Metrics : Align with business and with content strategy; No 'one metric' to rule them all*]


### Module 4: Algorithmic Accountability & Transparency
We’ll talk about how algorithms are creating a new object for journalistic investigation, which is giving rise to a specialized practice called algorithmic accountability reporting. I’ll detail what **methods you can use to investigate algorithms** on this beat, and I’ll talk about **how you can be more responsible** with the algorithms you might incorporate into your newswork. This module will cover:

* Why investigating algorithms in society is important for journalism ...[*Bad Decisions (potential for harm); Violate Expectations (of how an algorithm ought to be operating); Public Significance (consequences of a bad decision)*] [*Four Angles on Algorithms : Discrimination or unfairness; Errors & mistakes; Violation of laws or social norms; Human misuse*] [*AlgorithmTips.org*]
* How to approach investigation of algorithms using different methods ...[*Reverse engineering; Auditing; Poking and prodding; Crowdsourcing; Code reviews*]
* How to be transparent with your own use of algorithms in newswork ...[*how to be more ethical & accountable*] [*Data; Model; Inference; Interface } Human involvement*] [*Concerns : Costs of info production; Ethics issues; Trade secrets & competitive advantage; Manipulation & gaming*]
